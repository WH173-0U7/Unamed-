# DarcVoyd

A GPU-heavy game for mobile, being built from scratch. Right now it has a
black, film-styled menu (grain, flicker, colour fringing, glitches), settings,
a save system, and the very first moment of the game: a dark screen with one
option that switches on an old CRT television, which shows nothing yet.

## Direction (planned, not built yet)

- A **2D** game where the visual effects are the focus.
- Gameplay mixes **side-scrolling** sections and **top-down** sections.
- Tone: dark and creepy, in the style of the film-grain / glitch menu and the CRT television.

## Play

**Play in your browser:** https://wh173-0u7.github.io/Unamed-/

Every push to `main` (or the development branch) rebuilds the game and
publishes it there automatically (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

- **New game / Continue:** opens the game: a black screen with one option, *Turn on*.
- **Fullscreen:** the game asks for fullscreen on every tap, click or key press
  whenever it isn't fullscreen. On iPhone, use Share → Add to Home Screen.
- **Pause:** top-right button, or Esc on a computer.
- **Saving:** pausing is the save point. The game saves every time you pause
  (leaving the app pauses it too), and *Continue* brings you back to that
  exact pause screen. Saves are stored on the device.

## Tech

- TypeScript + [Three.js](https://threejs.org) on WebGL2, built with Vite.
- GPU shaders draw the menu's film grain / glitch layer and the CRT
  television (power-on sequence, static, scanlines, curved glass).
- Can later be wrapped as a native iOS / Android app (e.g. with Capacitor).

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local server, also reachable from a phone on the same Wi-Fi
npm run build    # production build into dist/
```

URL options: `?debug` shows FPS, `?pr=1` fixes the render resolution.
